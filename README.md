# Movie Explorer App With Vue 3 + TypeScript + Vite


### üö® Important

- The api endpoint used in this project isn't normally available in our country, so to use the project, please turn on your vpn. (without vpn you get an error after `timeout: 10000`)
- In pagination section, because of api limitiation, we could not access pages above 500, so a manual limit was placed on the number of totalPages (If the number of pages specified by the server was higher than 500).
